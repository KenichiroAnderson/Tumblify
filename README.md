# Tumblify

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Tumblify
**By:** 
- Ken Anderson
- Jackson Wilson
- Yafei Sedlacek


**Description:** Tumblify is a web platform that allows users to create and manage blogs. Registered users can post and comment on blogs, while unregistered users can browse and search the content. The site will feature real-time updates, user management, and administrative controls.

As a team, we have collaboratively explored various potential projects for this year and have decided to develop Tumblify. We believe this project will present interesting challenges that will enhance our programming skills and serve as a platform to showcase our collective development capabilities, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.

Our end goal is to create a user-friendly and reliable blogging platform. The website's interface will feature a seamlessly designed homepage, ensuring that first-time users can effortlessly navigate through our platform. All users will be able to browse and search blog posts by keywords.

Registered users will enjoy additional interactive features, including the ability to create and comment on blog posts, manage their profiles, and view/edit their profile details. Their user information and profile images will be securely stored in their accounts.

Administrators will have enhanced control features, such as the ability to search for users by name, email, or post, enable or disable user accounts, and edit or remove posts and threads. They will also have access to detailed usage reports and insights into site trends.

Our vision for Tumblify is to provide a dynamic and engaging platform where users can easily create and interact with blog content in real time.
